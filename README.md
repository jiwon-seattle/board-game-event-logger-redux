## 1. User Flow

This is a movie ticket booking site with create/read/update/delete functionality. A desirable user would be a administrator or employee of movie theater.

1. A user is able to receive movie data from movie API. When it is in progress or failed, it displays "Loading...". 
2. A user is able to choose employee mode in the first web page.
3. A user is able to create new movie in the system and that is added to a movie list.
4. A user is able to see all movies list in the main page.
5. A user is able to check each movie's detail in detail page.
6. A user is able to book or cancel the ticket in booking page.
7. A user is able to update ticket status as per reservation or cancellation.
8. When tickets are sold out(ticket quantities are equal to 0), the "Out of stock" message is shown.
9. Ticket quantities are limited to 8, so system notifies a user that limited ticket quantities when canceling tickets and ticket numbers is 8.
10. A user is able to delete a movie in detail page and the movie is excluded in the movie list in main page.
